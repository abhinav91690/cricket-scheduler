# Superpowers for Kiro

A complete software development workflow system that transforms your coding agent into a systematic, test-driven development powerhouse.

## What is Superpowers?

Superpowers is a collection of development skills that guide your AI agent through professional software development workflows. Instead of jumping straight into code, it enforces a systematic approach:

1. **Brainstorming** - Refines ideas through questions and design validation
2. **Planning** - Creates detailed, bite-sized implementation plans
3. **Test-Driven Development** - Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles
4. **Subagent-Driven Development** - Uses fresh subagents for each task with quality reviews
5. **Code Review** - Systematic review processes between tasks
6. **Git Workflows** - Proper branching and worktree management

## Key Benefits

- **Systematic Development**: No more ad-hoc coding - every feature follows a proven workflow
- **Test-First Approach**: Enforces TDD with no exceptions
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in code review and spec compliance checks
- **Autonomous Execution**: Agents can work for hours following the established plan
- **Professional Workflows**: Git branching, proper documentation, incremental commits
